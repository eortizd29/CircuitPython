# CircuitPython
## Hello CircuitPython (Metro and Mu)
### Objective
For this assignment you will be needing a LED light, some wires, a resistor, a bread board, and a metro. The objective of this task is to learn about this new programming language called CircuitPython. There is a new board called Metro that looks like the arduino but is different. What your going to try to do is make and LED fade in and out using the new programming language and board.

### Lessons
I completed this project by writing code that allowed for the LED to fade most importantly using import time and import board. This assignement was bringing back the basics of code and wiring. During this task I learned the basics of the program language Mu. I also learned about how the Metro board works and it's differences compared to arduino. 




## CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
For this assignment you won't be needing a bread board but will be needing a servo, some wires, and a metro. The objective of this task is to learn how to move a servo 180 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise by the touch of two wires each one controlling a different direction. Complete this by using a Metro Board and Mu as the programming language.

### Lessons
I completed this project by adding new code to the already existing code from moving a servo with a touch of a button. The main thing I added that allowed for the touch feature to work was import pulseio and import toucheio. I was cpmpletly new to the idea of touch features which was shown on my first attempts to complete this assignement. I ran into an issue where if I touched either of the wires the both rotated in the same direction. I resolved this by isolating each wire and writing seperate code for both of them using a while loop




## CircuitPython LCD Screen and botton
### Objective
For this assignment you will be needing an LCD screen, a button, and some wires apart from the bread board and metro. The objective of this task is for you to have the LCD screen display the amount of times you have clicked the button.

### Lessons
No very important new code was added to this learning experience. This assignment helped me better understand For and While loops and their eifficiency and simplicity it also gave me more experience with if statements and how to use them with physical actions such as touching a button. 




## CircuitPython Photo Interupter
### Objective
For this assignment you are only going to need a photo intterupter, some wires, and to make it even better you won't be needing a bread board. The objective of this task is for you to learn how to write code that counts everytime the photointeruppter is interupted by an object.

### Lessons
This assignment wasn't that difficult but it gave me insight to the the importance of my codes variables. To be more specific I learned about time.time and how the lower the variable is the faster it is to notice how many time the phtointeruppter was interupted. I also got to experiment with the commands that detemined how long the code ran for. Just a side note it was really impressive how many times it was able to detect the times it was interrupted.




## CircuitPython Ultrasonic Sensor

### Lessons
In this assignment I learned that using a flat surface is the best way to minimize the ultrasonic sensor glitches, also I need to be smarter about the delays I use. 




## CircuitPython Fancy RGB LED
### Objective
The purpose of this assigment was to use 2 rgb leds and 
display all the colors of the rainbow in order, and then 
create a color shift rainbow sequence with the same led 
the previous colors are displayed. (Hardest part is 
getting the leds to work)

### Lessons
I learned to use 3v instead of 5v to get better color definition. Also I learned how to wire and use an RGB LED and get the colors to work properly.
