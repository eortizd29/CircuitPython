# CircuitPython
## Hello CircuitPython (Metro and Mu)
### Objective
The objective of this task is to learn about this new programming language called CircuitPython. There is a new board called Metro that looks like the arduino but is different. What your going to try to do is make and LED fade in and out using the new programming language and board.

### Lessons
During this task I learned the basics of the program language Mu. I also learned about how the Metro board works and it's differnces compared to arduino. 



## CircuitPython Servo
[[]]
### Objective

The next assignment I did was a servo assignment.
I basically just made a servo turn by touching 2
different wires which made it go in either
direction, I set it to 180 degrees which ment it
went from one end of the servo to the other.

## CircuitPython LCD Screen and botton
[[]]
### Objective

The last assignment I did was I hooked up a button
and LCD screen to my metro board and then created a
code that allows it to count up by one on the LCD
if the button is pressed. The most difficult part was
trying to do it without an excessive use of time.sleep

### Lessons
This assignmetn taught me how to use the LCD to count up and how to wire a button to it to do so. I also taught me to desgin a code which counted up on click instead of on delay which was helpful and interesting. 


## CircuitPython Photo Interupter
[[]]
### Objective

In this assignment I used a photo interupter to print the
number of interupts o nthe srial monitor. It was a bit
difficult to not get it to just print out random interupt
numbers.

### Lessons
In the end I learned that I need to pay more attention to the corralation of my wiring to my coding to make sure everything is lined up correctly with each other, because in the assignments, one mistake can screw up the entire assignment. 


## CircuitPython Ultrasonic Sensor
[[]]
### Objective

In this assignment we used an ultrasonic sensor in orde
to change the RGB led light on the metro bored from 
red to green while, displaying all the colors in between 
the too like, blu, teal, purple, etc. 

### Pictures


### Lessons
In this assignment I learned that using a flat surface is the best way to minimize the ultrasonic sensor glitches, also I need to be smarter about the delays I use. 


## CircuitPython Fancy RGB LED
[[]]
### Objective

The purpose of this assigment was to use 2 rgb leds and 
display all the colors of the rainbow in order, and then 
create a color shift rainbow sequence with the same led 
the previous colors are displayed. (Hardest part is 
getting the leds to work)

### Pictures

### Lessons
I learned to use 3v instead of 5v to get better color definition. Also I learned how to wire and use an RGB LED and get the colors to work properly.
