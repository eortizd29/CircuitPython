# CircuitPython
## Hello CircuitPython (Metro and Mu)
### Objective
For this assignment you will be needing a LED light, some wires, a resistor, a bread board, and a metro. The objective of this task is to learn about this new programming language called CircuitPython. There is a new board called Metro that looks like the arduino but is different. What your going to try to do is make and LED fade in and out using the new programming language and board.

### Lessons
I completed this project by writing code that allowed for the LED to fade most importantly using import time and import board. This assignement was bringing back the basics of code and wiring. During this task I learned the basics of the program language Mu. I also learned about how the Metro board works and it's differences compared to arduino. 




## CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
For this assignment you won't be needing a bread board but will be needing a servo, some wires, and a metro. The objective of this task is to learn how to move a servo 180 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise by the touch of two wires each one controlling a different direction. Complete this by using a Metro Board and Mu as the programming language.

### Lessons
I completed this project by adding new code to the already existing code from moving a servo with a touch of a button. The main thing I added that allowed for the touch feature to work was import pulseio and import toucheio. I was cpmpletly new to the idea of touch features which was shown on my first attempts to complete this assignement. I ran into an issue where if I touched either of the wires the both rotated in the same direction. I resolved this by isolating each wire and writing seperate code for both of them using a while loop




## CircuitPython LCD Screen and botton
### Objective
For this assignment you will be needing an LCD screen, a button, and some wires apart from the bread board and metro. The objective of this task is for you to have the LCD screen display the amount of times you have clicked the button.

### Lessons
No very important new code was added to this learning experience. This assignment helped me better understand For and While loops and their eifficiency and simplicity it also gave me more experience with if statements and how to use them with physical actions such as touching a button. 




## CircuitPython Photo Interupter
### Objective
For this assignment you are only going to need a photo intterupter, some wires, and to make it even better you won't be needing a bread board. The objective of this task is for you to learn how to write code that counts everytime the photointeruppter is interupted by an object.

### Lessons
This assignment wasn't that difficult but it gave me insight to the the importance of my codes variables. To be more specific I learned about time.time and how the lower the variable is the faster it is to notice how many time the phtointeruppter was interupted. I also got to experiment with the commands that detemined how long the code ran for. Just a side note it was really impressive how many times it was able to detect the times it was interrupted.




## CircuitPython Ultrasonic Sensor
### Objective
For this assignment you are going to need an ultrasonic sensor, some wires, some resistors, a bread board, and a metro. The objective of this assignment is to write code that can tell the distnace between sensor and another object. To add on, the code is going to have to change the color of the metro board light based on the distance from the sensor and the object.

### Lessons
This was by far the most difficult assignment I have had to complete. The most difficult part was writing the statements that changed the colors based on the distance. I had trouble sorting the variables so they wouldn't overead by each other but have smooth transitions that were clear. This assignment taught me how to further assign and declare variables and also the importance of it.




## CircuitPython Fancy RGB LED
### Objective
For this assignment you will be needing a 2 RGB Led's, some wires, some resistors, a metro, and a bread board. The objective of this assignment is for you to write code for the LED's to display 6 different colors in the rainbow in a set sequence.

### Lessons
Like the Ultrasonic Sensor, this assignment was more difficult than the rest bringing up new challenges in my code. Like the Sensor, I was going to have to display different colors bringing back up the issue of assigning variables but this time it was different due to the fact I was working with more colors. WHat really got the best of me was the end of the code which was the rainbow section that took me a while to understand.



## Fancy LED
### Objective
For this assignment you will be needing 6 LED's, resistors, wires, a metro, and a bread board. This assignment is similar to the Fancy RGB LED assignment. You are going to have to make 6 LED's light up in a certain sequences but unlike the RGB these LED's can only produce one color which makes it different since you have to declare variables for all 6 LED's.

### Lessons
Like the past 3 assignments, this one was also difficult because it intorduced me to new sequences for LED's. I had trouble with the fact that now I didn't have to make the LED fade but also switch, alternate, flash ect.
